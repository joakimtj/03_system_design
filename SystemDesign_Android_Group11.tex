\begin{itemize}
    \item Data storage and management:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Firebase Firestore to store chats, messages and user data.
        \item Firestore will handle chat and message synchronization.
        \item E.g., room exipration.
    \end{itemize}
    \item User management:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is no user authentication planned due to the anonymized nature of the app.
        \item Most relevant user data (preferences as such) will be stored locally.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Navigation}

Our app is comprised of four main screens.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main Screen
    \item Chat
    \item Settings/Profile
    \item Create / Join
\end{itemize}

The main screen will list your currently active chats -- as well as when they are set to expire. A floating action button is present that will allow you to create a chat or join an existing one.

The settings/profile screen is where you will select your display name, your tripcode, your chat bubble customization and your picture. (optional)

The create / join screen allows you to enter a code, if that code is in use (e.g., a chat is actively using that code), you will join it, if not, you will create a new chat. You can also join existing chats using a QR code.
\\\\
Below is a graph representation of the app's navigation. The screens are unlikely to change much from the project proposal outside of changes made to comport with Material Design principles.
\\\\
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    node distance = 1cm and 2cm,
    box/.style = {rectangle, draw, text width=2.5cm, text centered, minimum height=1cm},
    smallbox/.style = {rectangle, draw, text width=2cm, text centered, minimum height=0.8cm},
    arrow/.style = {->, >=stealth}
]

% Define nodes
\node[box] (main) {Main Screen (Chat List)};
\node[box, below=of main] (chat) {Chat};
\node[box, below right=of main] (settings) {Settings};
\node[box, below left=of main] (joinchat) {Create/Join Chat};


% Draw arrows
\draw[arrow] (main) -- (chat);
\draw[arrow] (main) -- (settings);
\draw[arrow] (main) -- (joinchat);
\draw[dotted] (joinchat) -- (chat);


\end{tikzpicture}

The dotted lines represent navigation to the chat that has been joined/created. \\ \\

After some consideration, we've decided that we will join the Create and Join screens together.

The primary screens we have planned are shown in the images below.

\section{Resources}

We plan to source most art assets externally if we deviate from this we will, of course, document it. It's a little difficult to make this decision right now. But we do know that the following will be sourced externally: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Material Design symbols for common actions.
    \item Sound effects (if implemented). E.g. push notifications.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Classes}
We intend to implement these classes.
\begin{verbatim}
    MainActivity: Entry point of the app.
    
    WelcomeViewModel: Handles logic for joining/creating rooms.
    
    ChatViewModel: Manages chat messages and room data.
    
    ChatRepository: Interacts with Firebase services.
    
    User: Data class for user information (nickname, tripcode).
    
    ChatRoom: Data class for room information.
    
    Message: Data class for chat messages.
    
    TripcodeGenerator: Utility class for generating tripcodes.
    
    DateTimeUtils: Utility class for handling date/time operations.
    
    FirebaseManager: Singleton for initializing and accessing Firebase services.
    \end{verbatim}
This is not an exhaustive list and there may be more that we are missing but those will be documented as we add them.

\newpage
\section{External libraries/dependencies}
Here are the external libraries that we intend to use. We may find better alternatives as we develop the app.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Firebase SDK
    \item Jetpack Compose
    \item Jetpack Navigation
    \item Kotlin Coroutines
    \item Hilt
    \item Coil
\end{itemize}

\section{Help}
The Firebase integration and real-time synchroniation between server and device is probably what we might need the most help with.
